```vhdl
entity HX711 is

Description
-----------
The HX711 is an SBA IPCore designed to driver the [HX711] module, a precision 24-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) designed for weigh scales and industrial control applications to interface directly with a bridge sensor. The SBA core has 2 register of 16 bits, selected by  ADR_I to access the 24 bits of the HX711, MSW register:ADR_I(0)=1 and LSW register:ADR_I(0)=0, the INT flag can be readed in the bit 15 of the MSW, reading the MSW also clear the INT condition. INT is asserted when a new data is available.
